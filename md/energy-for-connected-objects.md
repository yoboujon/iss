# Energy for Connected Objects

## Introduction

Remote and wireless transmission of power emerged with the invention of Tesla coils with Nikola Tesla. He wanted to make a near-field inductive and capacitive coupling to power numerous object with great distance. In 1901 New York attempted to create a large power delivery structure now called *Wardenclyffe Tower*. Its purpose was to deliver power to everyone wirelessely, unfortunately because the costs went out, in 1904 this idea was scrapped.

The development of Radio-communication during the WWII for military purposes helped the research around transferring data over waves. This technology took different path and shape, with the invention of the magnetron by *John Randall* and *Harry Boot*. This leads to the discovery of the microwave beam by *Percy Spencer*; when an object containing water is exposed in a powerful 2.4 GHz wave, its molecules start to move rapidly, hence, heat is created.

In 2024, we are submerged in dense waves: Wi-Fi, bluetooth, radio, television: this stream does not only contain data, but power too, that can in theory be harvested.

> The need for wireless power source came in 2014 when the robot Philae landed on the asteroid *"67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko"*. After a bouncy landing, the robot was stuck in shadowed cliff, because it was solar-powered, Philae could not send any data for nearly 60 hours, waiting for the asteroid to face the sun.

Far-field energy distribution can be achieved using radiative (microwave/radio-frequency) or laser. Lasers are nowadays used, in an experimental way, for certain missions, it can be quite dangerous and need a line of sight that is precise. Radiative energy delivery on the other hand can be used in wider areas on earth and are less sensible to direction. Certain frequencies can be used and deliver power up to kilometers.

This could help countries that face unprecedented natural disasters cutting off power, by giving them a way to wirelessly gather power. We could harvest the power that is all around us with the correct technology too. This practical work is aimed towards these ideas, we need to power an LED using Wi-Fi or other frequencies. We will first focus on the power needed for such an application, then test it on a real hardware designed for it.
